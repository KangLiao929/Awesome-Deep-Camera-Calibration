# Benchmark for Learning-based Camera Calibration and Beyond

## :circus_tent: Standard Pinhole Model 

We collected 300 high-resolution images on the Internet, captured by popular digital cameras such as Canon, Fujifilm, Nikon, Olympus, Sigma, Sony, etc. For each image, we provide the specific focal length of its lens. We have included a diverse range of subjects, including landscapes, portraits, wildlife, architecture, etc. The range of focal length is from 4.5mm to 600mm, allowing users to explore the different effects that different lenses can have on an image.

## :circus_tent: Distortion Camera Model 

We created a comprehensive dataset for the distortion camera model, with a focus on wide-angle cameras. The dataset is comprised of three subcategories. The first is a synthetic dataset, which was generated using the widely-used 4$^{th}$ order polynomial model. It contains both circular and rectangular structures, with 1,000 distortion-rectification image pairs. The second subcategory consists of data captured under real-world settings, derived from the raw calibration data for around 40 types of wide-angle cameras. For each calibration data, the intrinsics, extrinsics, and distortion coefficients are available. Finally, we exploit a car equipped with different cameras to capture video sequences. The scenes cover both indoor and outdoor environments, including daytime and nighttime footage.
